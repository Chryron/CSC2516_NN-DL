    "Using numpy only, implement backward pass or a sigmoid MLP. Specifically, you will need to implement this functionality in the `train` function in the `SigmoidMLP` class below. You should write numpy code to populate the two lists `weight_gradients` and `bias_gradient`, where each entry in each list corresponds to the gradient for a weight matrix or bias vector for each layer. Then, when you run the code cell at the bottom of this notebook, the trained MLP should output (approximately) 0, 1, 1, 0, having learned the [XOR function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or).
