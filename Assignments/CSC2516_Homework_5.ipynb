    "# 2. CIFAR-10 classification (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "CIFAR-10 is a standard dataset where the goal is to classify 32 x 32 images into one of 10 classes. The goal of this problem is simple: build and train a convolutional neural network to perform classification on CIFAR-10. The problem is intentionally extremely open-ended! There are dozens (hundreds?) of tutorials online describing how to train a convnet on CIFAR-10 - please seek them out and make use of them. I recommend getting started with the [CIFAR-10 tutorial from PyTorch](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/tutorials/blob/gh-pages/_downloads/cifar10_tutorial.ipynb) which includes code for loading the dataset and evaluating performance on it. You are welcome to use any other resource that you want (but please cite it!) - as I mentioned there are many, many tutorials online, and googling for help is an utterly crucial skill for a researcher! You will be graded on the final test accuracy achieved by your model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 60% accuracy or higher: 2/4 points\n",
    "- 75% accuracy or higher: 3/4 points\n",
    "- 90% accuracy or higher: 4/4 points\n",
    "- Highest accuracy in the class: 4/3 points!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in order for us to know the final performance of your model, you will need to implement a function that computes the accuracy of your model on the test set (which appears in both of the linked tutorials above). The only rules are: You can only train your model on the CIFAR-10 training set (i.e. you can't use pre-trained models or other datasets for additional training, and you certaintly can't train on the CIFAR-10 test set!), and you must train the model on the free Colab GPU or TPU. This means you can only train the model for an hour or so! This is *much* less compute than is typically used for training CIFAR-10 models. As such, this is as much an exercise in building an accurate model as it is in building an efficient one. This is a popular game to play, and to the best of my knowledge the state-of-the-art is [this approach](https://myrtle.ai/learn/how-to-train-your-resnet/) which attains 96% accuracy in only *26 seconds* on a single GPU! (note that the final link on that page is broken; it should be [this](https://myrtle.ai/learn/how-to-train-your-resnet-8-bag-of-tricks/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of things you can try to make your model more accurate and/or more efficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deeper models\n",
    "1. Residual connections\n",
    "1. [Data augmentation and normalization](https://d2l.ai/chapter_computer-vision/kaggle-cifar10.html#image-augmentation)\n",
    "1. Regularization like dropout or weight decay\n",
    "1. [Learning rate schedules](https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/lr-scheduler.html)\n",
    "1. [Different forms of normalization](https://d2l.ai/chapter_convolutional-modern/batch-norm.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we haven't covered all these topics in class yet, but you should be able to get to at least 60% accuracy without applying all of these ideas - and probably 75% by tweaking around a little bit. Specifically, you should be able to get about 60% accuracy by taking the basic AlexNet architecture we discussed in class and applying it directly to CIFAR-10. And, if you're feeling adventurous, feel free to go for 96% using the aforementioned blog series! Good luck!"
